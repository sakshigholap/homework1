What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

In Git, a merge and a rebase are two different ways to combine changes from different branches. 
The biggest difference is that merge combines the changes from two different branches and then 
creates a new commit with said changes. In the project history, you can access the two seperate 
branches in the project history. On the other hand, rebase takes the changes from one branch and 
applies them directly to another branch, making a linear project history. Overall, the key 
difference is with what the project history looks like. The choice between merge and rebase 
depends on what you want your project history to look like.

What is a remote repository?

In Git, a remote repository is a copy of a repository that is hosted on a different server or 
location than the local one on your computer. It allows you to sync your local repository with
changes from others and share your own changes, making it great for collaboration.
